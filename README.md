# Discover Meteor Book in Coffeescript

This is a working version of the Telescope project as described in the Discover Meteor book.

* Up to Chapter 14
* Up to date as of 23rd May 2015
* First attempt at writing Coffeescript

I'm making this repo available because at times, it was difficult to learn Coffeescript while also learning Meteor. Therefore, my Coffeescript styling may vary throughout the repo. The most challenging part was handling global variables which in regular JS is achieved my omitting `var`.
